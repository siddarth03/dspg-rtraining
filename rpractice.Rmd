## Intro to markdown

Markdown allows you to do things like **bold**, *italic*, and more!

Make a list with asterisks like:

\* bold with double-asterisks

\* italics with underscores

\* code-type fond with backticks

You can also use hyphens instead of asterisks.

For a numbered list:

1\. bold...

1\. italic...

1\. code....

Hyperlinks are like [Hyperlinked text](https://mylink.org)

```

```{r}
temp <- c(1,2,3)

```
